	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few studies have concerned the absolute apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the normal human brain and the effect of aging on diffusion. Therefore, our purpose was to determine whether the average ADC (ADCav) values in the various regions of the brain differ with age, sex, or hemisphere and to establish reference values of the absolute ADCav for further studies.METHODS: Subjects (40 men and 40 women) were chosen from a healthy population; age groups were 20{\textendash}34, 35{\textendash}49, and 50{\textendash}64 years and 65 years or older (n = 20 each). All subjects were examined with MR imaging, including conventional and diffusion-weighted imaging in three orthogonal directions with two b values (0 and 1000 s/mm2) at 1.5 T. Bilateral ADCav values were determined in 36 regions of interest encompassing the entire brain.RESULTS: ADCav values were highest in the cortical gray matter ([0.89 {\textpm} 0.04] {\texttimes} 10-3 mm2/s; range, 0.78{\textendash}1.09 {\texttimes} 10-3), lower in the deep gray matter ([0.75 {\textpm} 0.03] {\texttimes} 10-3 mm2/s; range, 0.64{\textendash}0.83 {\texttimes} 10-3), and lowest in the white matter ([0.70 {\textpm} 0.03] {\texttimes} 10-3 mm2/s; range, 0.62{\textendash}0.79 {\texttimes} 10-3). The ADCav values did not significantly change with aging, except for an increase in the lateral ventricles. No difference was observed between women and men or between the hemispheres.CONCLUSION: The data reported herein are representative, and the ADCav values can be used for reference in future studies and in clinical settings.},

It is shown that several important modifications must be made to this sequence to permit T1 to be measured accurately and reliably. With these modifications it is possible to measure T1 with a mean systematic error of -1.5\% (-0.3\% for samples with T1 > 300 ms), a mean accuracy of 3.1\% (2.1\% for samples with T1 > 300 ms) and a mean repeatability of 1.4\% (1.4\% for samples with T1 > 300 ms), using data collected in 6.4 min from sixteen 128 × 128 matrix images.}

abstract = {Abstract Polyvinyl alcohol-cryogel (PVA-C) is a hydrogel that is an excellent tissue mimic. In order to characterize mass transfer in this material, as well as to demonstrate in principle the ability to noninvasively measure solute diffusion in tissue, we measured the diffusion coefficient of the magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent gadolinium diethylene triaminopentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) through PVA-C using a clinical MR imager. The method involved filling thick-walled rectangular PVA-C “cups” with known concentrations of Gd-DTPA solutions. Then by using a fast inversion recovery spin echo MR imaging protocol, a signal “null” contour was created in the MR image that corresponded to a second, known concentration of Gd-DTPA. By collecting a series of MR images through the PVA-C wall as a function of time, the displacement of this second known isoconcentration contour could be tracked. Application of Fick's second law of diffusion yielded the diffusion coefficient. Seven separate experiments were performed using various combinations of initial concentrations of Gd-DTPA within the PVA-C cups (3.2, 25.6, or 125 mM) and tracked isoconcentrations contours (0.096, 0.182, or 0.435 mM Gd-DTPA). The experimental results and the predictions of Fick's law were in excellent agreement. The diffusivity of Gd-DTPA through 10\% PVA hydrogel was found to be (2.6 ± 0.04) × 10−10 m2/s (mean ± s.e.m.). Separate permeability studies showed that the diffusion coefficient of Gd-DTPA through this hydrogel did not change with an applied pressure of up to 7.1 kPa. Accurate measurements could be made within 30 min if suitable Gd-DTPA concentrations were selected. Due to the excellent repeatability and fast data acquisition time, this technique is very promising for future in vivo studies of species transport in tissue. © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

    abstract = {The three-dimension (3D) magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence is one of the most popular sequences for structural brain imaging in clinical and research settings. The sequence captures high tissue contrast and provides high spatial resolution with whole brain coverage in a short scan time. In this paper, we first computed the optimal k-space sampling by optimizing the contrast of simulated images acquired with the MP-RAGE sequence at 3.0 Tesla using computer simulations. Because the software of our scanner has only limited settings for k-space sampling, we then determined the optimal k-space sampling for settings that can be realized on our scanner. Subsequently we optimized several major imaging parameters to maximize normal brain tissue contrasts under the optimal k-space sampling. The optimal parameters are flip angle of 12°, effective inversion time within 900 to 1100 ms, and delay time of 0 ms. In vivo experiments showed that the quality of images acquired with our optimal protocol was significantly higher than that of images obtained using recommended protocols in prior publications. The optimization of k-spacing sampling and imaging parameters significantly improved the quality and detection sensitivity of brain images acquired with MP-RAGE.},
